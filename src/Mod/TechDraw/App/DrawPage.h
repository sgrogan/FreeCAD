/*!
 * Relationship between DrawPage and GIPage (+children):
 *
 * Doing anything useful with TechDraw requires using QGraphicsScene and
 * QGraphicsItems, but it's not safe to assume that we will always have access
 * to those classes (for example, if built with BUILD_GUI=0).  We do however
 * always want to support loading/saving FreeCAD documents that contain
 * TechDraw items, so we need to always build classes that contain Properties.
 *
 * The current model involves three layers, where one is built regardless of
 * whether we have access to Qt, then the other two are intended for varying
 * levels of interaction with QGraphics.  The GUI/non-GUI distinction is an
 * an attempt at following the App/Gui split in the rest of FreeCAD, and
 * allows us to use the QGraphics via command line with minimal overhead.
 *
 * DrawPage - Contains Properties
 * GIPage - Handles non-GUI aspects of QGraphics
 * QGVPage - Derived from GIPage, adds GUI interaction
 *
 * The intent is to have only one GIPage-derived instance per DrawPage.  To
 * facilitate this, we have a DrawPage* stored by GIPage, and DrawPage contains
 * registerGi(), deregisterGi(), and getGi() methods.
